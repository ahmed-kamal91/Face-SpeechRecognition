## intro
thank you for intersting! </br>
in the first place this is computer vision project for college.i tried to mix two fields in my project.
Most of it belongs to computer vision (80%) and the rest to speech recognititon (20%)
it si all about recognising the face  in webcam and pronunce person's name

## Idea behind
computer recognise persons by comparing encodings for the face in webcam with encodings already groupped in a list and getting person's name

## input / Output
here input is the list of image for each face we want to recognise when appearing in camera. each image has its name of the person as name of image
and we will get encodings for each one (actually it is a group of image inside a folder in the project)
